# Image Classification with Deep Learning

This is a **Deep Learning** based project that classifies images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Users can upload an image, and the model will predict which category the image belongs to.

### Features:
- **Image Classification**: Upload an image and get predictions on the category it belongs to.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple, interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Fast Prediction**: The app uses a pre-trained model for quick predictions on uploaded images.

### Tech Stack:
- **TensorFlow**: Training Deep Learning model and making predictions.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Model architecture for classifying images.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and image preprocessing.
- **Pillow**: Handling image processing and resizing.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
